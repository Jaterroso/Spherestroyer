## Unity Tiny gotchas:
### Materials:
- Tiny is using `Unity.Tiny.Rendering.MeshRenderer` while Editor is using `Unity.Rendering.RenderMesh`. If you want to
change materials at runtime, use two systems

### Audio
- There is a bug where if you play web audio clip, it also calls window.stop() https://forum.unity.com/threads/tiny-3rd-party-api-requests-iframes-bug.819057/#post-5437542
- To run an audio, use `AudioSourceStart`. `Play On Awake` is adding this component automatically, but it needs
to be added only after the first input from the user (browser restriction).
- It seems that import settings do not reduce the final file size(?). Import optimized sound file

### UI Hack
- Since there is no UI yet, you can use quad with texture as a substitute. URP unlit transparent material with
`Render Face: Both` otherwise it is not visible during DOTS runtime
- If you want multiple layers, make sure that the object you wish on top is sibling, lower in hierarchy, and has material with lower priority

### JS interaction
- To interact with JS, the folder `js~` and the .cs script with extern functions must be in the root folder with `asm.def`.
The library should have `.js` instead of `.jslib`
- The game is blocking event propagation, listen for JS events on canvas level.

### Misc
- `IJobForEach<T>` works in editor even with only Tag components, but not in DOTS runtime >> replace with Entities.WithAll<T>.ForEach
- Remember to always use `RequireSingletonForUpdate<T>()` in `OnStartRunning()` / `OnCreate()` when using singleton
- Uncheck `Use GUIDs` on `asm.def` files, otherwise build will fail.
- Don't use spaces in folder names, otherwise build will fail.
- Component `NonUniformScale` , which is added automatically for entities with scale other than 1, is used instead of component
`Scale` by internal systems. Make authoring script add `NonUniformScale` and use that in your systems instead of `Scale` so it works for both cases.
- Removing a `Disabled` component via unrelated EntityQuery works in Debug only if the query is created in the same frame the component is removed (not in OnCreate where you would usually create queries).
It works correctly in Release either way.
